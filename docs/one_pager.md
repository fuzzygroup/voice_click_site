# Overview

This document is a one page overview of the Voice Click opportunity. At the end of reading this the overall business opportunity should be coherent and apparent; if not this document is an abject failure.

# Opportunity

The elevator pitch for this opportunity is simple:

> DoubleClick for the emerging world of Voice User Interface (VUI) based computing.

A new world of computing is literally upon us -- and it is powered by what we term the VUI or *Voice User Interface*.  VUI devices already exist in three constructs: 

* Amazon Alexa
* Google Home
* Apple Siri
* Microsoft Cortana

These devices provide ad hoc access to data in the same way that a browser does.  And where there is an opportunity to access data there is a need for a monetization mechanism.  We believe that monetization mechanism will be **advertising** and the opportunity is a soup to nuts ad serving, analytics and insertion tool similar to what DoubleClick did for web pages.  We call this business **Voice Click**.

Our initial goto market strategy is to build on top of the Amazon Alexa VUI platform as Alexa appears to be the initial market leader.  With this strategy we are internally adopting the Alexa vocabulary where an Alexa Skill is roughly the equivalent of an app in mobile computing.

# Solution

The solution is a hosted ad platform with the following components:

* A web presence
* The means for an advertiser to signup, create campaigns, create ads, etc
* An ad server for serving ads that are dynamically inserted into VUI computing streams in a reasonable, tasteful way
* An analytics engine for capturing data
* An end user app, Voice Click, that lets the user capture information from the ad so it can be viewed at their leisure
* A series of VUI skills for the Amazon Alexa platform that serve as proof of concept for how you might monetize a VUI skill
* A developer SDK
* An end user skill Email Me that lets a user capture information from an ad and deliver it to their email address

Note: Potential advertisers need to hire voice acting talent to create an ad for them. Is there a way to allow existing voice talent to register on the site and advertise themselves.

# Marketing

The initial marketing work will be mostly blogging / thought leadership writing to establish ourselves as conceptual leaders in this space and capture developer attention.  Once a product is near shipping then actual product marketing work can begin.

# Opportunity Size

We think this opportunity, while not as large as mobile, is huge in its scope.  It isn't hard to imagine every household having one or more VUI device.  If that is correct then VUI devices will be enabled with multiple different skills all of which need monetization in one form or another.  And that doesn't even touch on these devices appearing in the work place.

# Technological Challenges

The following challenges are at hand:

* These devices work at the house hold instead of individual user level so we generally know a location we are speaking to but not the individual within the location.  
* Development approach is entirely different across devices; there is no SDK compatibility across the different VUI computing platforms.
